neuromaps
=========

The ``neuromaps`` toolbox is designed to help researchers make easy,
statistically-rigorous comparisons between brain maps (or brain annotations).

Installation requirements
-------------------------

Currently, ``neuromaps`` works with Python 3.7+ and requires a few
dependencies:

- matplotlib
- nibabel (>=3.0)
- nilearn (>=0.7)
- numpy (>=1.14)
- scikit-learn (>=0.17)
- scipy

You can get started by installing ``neuromaps`` from the source repository
with:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/netneurolab/neuromaps
    cd neuromaps
    pip install neuromaps

You will also need to have `Connectome Workbench <https://www.humanconnectome.
org/software/connectome-workbench>`_ installed and available on your path in
order to use most of the transformation / resampling functionality of
``neuromaps``.
